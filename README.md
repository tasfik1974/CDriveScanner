# Paths Parser

Retrieves data about file paths found in `.txt` files.

## What does it do?
- **Parses** the paths from `.txt` files.
  - For example, a line like `0x1ffd7017eb0 (109): \??\C:\users\user\desktop\cheat.dll` would be parsed into `C:\users\user\desktop\cheat.dll`.
- **Checks digital signatures** for each file:
  - Checks for **Catalog** and **Authenticode** signatures.   
  - Reports **"Deleted"** if the file is not found.
  - Detects specific digital signatures (e.g., *Slinky* and *Vape*, which are known cheats).
  - Reports **"Signed"** or **"Not signed"** for each present file.
- **Applies generic checks** to each present file (more on generics below).
- **Checks for "replacements"** using the USN journal for each file (Explorer, Copy, or Type patterns are detected).

## How to Use

1. **Place your target paths in one or more of these files** (either in `C:\` or in the same folder as the program):
   - `search results.txt`
   - `paths.txt`
   - `p.txt`

   Each file can contain any number of lines. Lines that contain paths like `C:\somefolder\somefile.exe` will be automatically parsed. The code will ignore invalid entries or lines that do not contain a proper file path.

2. **Run the compiled executable** (e.g., `PathsParser.exe`).  

3. Choose if you want either my rules, your own(more on this bellow), replaceparser, or scanning DLLs only.

4. The console will display:
   - Whether each file is **present or deleted**.  
   - The **digital signature** status.  
   - Any **generic** or **specific detection** hits.  

5. When finished, the program will:
   - Write any found replacements to `replaces.txt` (in the same folder as the program) and opens it .
   - **Review `replaces.txt`** to see the summary of replacement findings (if any).

### csrss DLL detection example

1. Execute either **System Informer** or **Process Hacker** with **kernel mode** enabled.
2. Search for the process `csrss.exe` with the highest private bytes
3. Click on properties, then dump its memory and strings.
4. After dumping filer for this regex as case insensitive: `^(?:\\\\\?\\)?[A-Za-z]:\\.+$`, it will search for any files with the format <Driveletter>:\.
5. Click on the "Save..." button.
6. Save the text file on the same path as the Paths Parser or on drive C (`C:\`).
7. Open PathsParser.exe, choose if you want generic rules, choose if you want your own rules, choose if you want replacements, and say "y" to the scan for DLLs only.

### csrss EXE detection example

1. Execute either **System Informer** or **Process Hacker** with **kernel mode** enabled.
2. Search for the process `csrss.exe` with the lowest private bytes
3. Click on properties, then dump its memory and strings.
4. After dumping filer for this regex as case insensitive: `^(?!.*\.dll$)(?:\\\\\?\\)?[A-Za-z]:\\.+$`, it will ignore .dlls as you should look for them as the DLL detection example shows.
5. Click on the "Save..." button.
6. Save the text file on the same path as the Paths Parser or on drive C (`C:\`).
7. Open PathsParser.exe, choose if you want generic rules, choose if you want your own rules, choose if you want replacements, and say "n" to the scan for DLLs only.

### custom yara rules example

To use custom rules on my tools first of all, when opening it, it'll ask you if you want to use my rules, then if you want to use your owns, say yes to use your owns.
When saying yes to using your owns, it will scan for all .yar files on the same direcotry as pahtsparser, and will use those rules, it will show the rules in the same way it shows my generics, with the rule name beeing shown on brackets and in red to the right of the filepath.
